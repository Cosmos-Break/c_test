Built on a site long favored by pre-Columbian peoples  Lock Haven began in 1833 as a timber town and a haven for loggers  boatmen  and other travelers on the river or the West Branch Canal  Resource extraction and efficient transportation financed much of the city's growth through the end of the 19th century  In the 20th century  a light-aircraft factory  a college  and a paper mill  along with many smaller enterprises  drove the economy  Frequent floods  especially in 1972  damaged local industry and led to a high rate of unemployment in the 1980s 

The city has three sites on the National Register of Historic Places—Memorial Park Site  a significant pre-Columbian archaeological find; Heisey House  a Victorian-era museum; and Water Street District  an area with a mix of 19th- and 20th-century architecture  A levee  completed in 1995  protects the city from further flooding  While industry remains important to the city  about a third of Lock Haven's workforce is employed in education  health care  or social services
